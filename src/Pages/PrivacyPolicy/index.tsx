          <h2>What Information Do We Collect?
          </h2>
          <p>
          At Indrajala Movie Makers LLP, we collect various types of information to enhance your experience on our Site. When you visit or navigate our platform, certain personal information about you, such as your IP address, may be automatically recorded. This information helps us understand your usage patterns and improve our services. However, if you choose to utilize specific services on our Site, you will be required to provide additional personal information to register for and access these services. This may include essential details such as your first and last name, username, password, email address, contact address, and mobile or telephone numbers. Additionally, we may collect information related to your computer's hardware and software, as well as any other relevant data needed for your interaction with our services, allowing us to discern your identity.
          </p>

          <p>
          Beyond the direct information you provide, we may also gather demographic data that is not uniquely identifiable to you, such as location data, codes, preferences, and favorites. Furthermore, while using certain third-party services available on our Site, we may indirectly collect additional information about your interactions and preferences. For example, we monitor the specific services you access and the areas you visit within our Site. This information is invaluable as it enables us to deliver the web pages you request, tailor our Site to your interests, and measure overall traffic and engagement levels. Advertisers, third-party companies, and service providers may also utilize this data to personalize content and advertisements relevant to you.
          </p>

          <p>
           In the context of our subscription services, we collaborate with third-party payment gateway partners to process transactions related to your subscription package. When you purchase a subscription, these payment gateways will collect essential information, such as your credit or debit card details, or other bank account information necessary to facilitate your payment. Importantly, Indrajala Movie Makers LLP does not directly collect or store any financial information from you, including credit card numbers or net banking details. We emphasize that the payment gateways operate independently, and when you engage with these services, you do so at your own risk. Each payment gateway may have its own privacy policy, and we strongly recommend that you review these policies before providing any personal information or conducting transactions through them.
          </p>

          <p>
          As part of these transactions, you may need to provide sensitive financial information, including bank account details or credit card information. It is crucial for you to understand that we do not receive or have access to your financial details from these payment gateways. Your personal information, including sensitive data and financial information, will be handled according to the respective privacy policies of these third-party services. Consequently, we will not be liable for any personal information, sensitive personal data, or financial information you provide to these payment gateways. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements of these services before sharing any information or engaging in transactions with them, ensuring you are informed about their practices and policies.

This means that when you make a payment for our services, certain personal information is collected to facilitate the transaction securely.

We emphasize that your personal information, including your name, email address, phone number, and other identifiable details, will not be shared with external third parties—those not affiliated with our group, holding, subsidiary, or fellow subsidiary companies—without your explicit prior consent for marketing or related purposes. This policy is in place to protect your privacy and ensure that your data is handled responsibly. The information you provide is integral to enhancing your overall experience on our platform, as it enables us to tailor our services to better meet your needs.

You have the flexibility to manage your communication preferences during registration and can opt out at any time by following the instructions provided in our emails or messages. To better understand our user base and refine our offerings, we conduct surveys and analysis, using aggregated data to derive insights. Your information is also vital for providing exceptional customer support, resolving any disputes that arise, and ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
          </p>

          <p>
          Moreover, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information when required by law or when we believe it is necessary to protect our rights or those of others. This includes situations where we receive judicial orders, court directives, or legal processes. To facilitate our operations, we may share your information with trusted service providers who assist in various aspects of our platform's functioning, ensuring they have the necessary access to perform their roles efficiently. In certain cases, we may also supplement the personal information you submit with data from third-party sources, enhancing our understanding of your preferences and behaviors. This combined information may also be utilized for targeted advertising, showing you content and advertisements tailored to your interests. Ultimately, our commitment is to safeguard your rights while delivering a secure, personalized experience that aligns with your needs and expectations, ensuring transparency and accountability in how your information is managed.

          <h2>Changing Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
          You have the ability to access and modify your personal information by signing into your account on our Site. However, it is important to note that we do not alter the information you provide; instead, we encourage you to proactively update your details whenever there are changes, such as a new phone number or email address. Keeping your personal information current is essential not only for your account security but also for ensuring that we can effectively communicate with you regarding your services and updates. If you have made a public posting on our platform, please be aware that you may not be able to change or remove that content after it has been shared, reflecting the transparency and permanence of online interactions.
          </p>

          <p>
          If you decide that you no longer wish to maintain your account, you can request its closure. We will take steps to remove your personal information from public view as soon as reasonably possible, taking into consideration your account activity and compliance with applicable laws. However, it's important to understand that even after account closure, we may retain your personal information for several critical reasons. This includes compliance with legal obligations, preventing and investigating potential illegal activities, and addressing security issues. Retaining this information helps us protect the rights and safety of our organization and users, and ensures that we can respond to any legal claims or violations effectively.

          <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
          Our website employs cookies and a variety of tracking technologies to enhance user experience and gather essential information about site interactions. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit our site. They allow us to collect data on your browsing behavior, such as the pages you visit, the duration of your visit, and your preferences. This data is invaluable for personalizing your experience, as cookies can remember information you’ve previously entered, such as login credentials or preferences for content display. Most web browsers offer controls that allow you to manage cookie settings, including options to accept, reject, or delete cookies. However, it’s important to note that by opting to block or delete cookies, you may encounter limitations on your access to certain features or functionalities of our website. For instance, blocking cookies may require you to manually re-enter your login information each time you access specific areas of our platform, as cookies are used to maintain your logged-in status. Additionally, cookies can improve the overall performance of the website, ensuring that content loads faster and is relevant to your interests.
          </p>

          <p>
          In addition to cookies, we employ various tracking technologies to gather information about your browsing habits and device information. This includes logging details such as your Internet domain and host names, IP addresses, types of browsers and operating systems, clickstream patterns, and timestamps indicating when you access our site. By analyzing this data, we can identify usage trends, optimize site functionality, and enhance user experience by tailoring our content to better meet the needs of our visitors. To analyze our website traffic further, we utilize Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. This service collects data on site usage, which helps us understand how users interact with our platform. The data gathered may also be shared with other Google services, and Google may use it to personalize advertisements within its advertising network. If you wish to opt-out of having your activity tracked by Google Analytics, you can do so by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript from sharing information about your visits with Google Analytics.
          </p>

          <p>
          Furthermore, our website may contain links to third-party sites that are not under our control. If you click on a link leading to a third-party site, you will be redirected to that site, and we strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of that site. We do not assume responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites, as they may have different policies and practices regarding user data collection and management. Lastly, we may share your information within our corporate group, including parent, subsidiary, or affiliated companies, especially in the context of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales. In such cases, your information may be transferred to ensure business continuity and compliance with legal obligations. We remain committed to protecting your information and ensuring that it is handled in accordance with applicable privacy regulations.

            <h2>How Long Do We Store Your Information</h2>
            <p>
            We are committed to retaining your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill our obligations to you, which may vary depending on the nature of the services provided and the legal framework governing our operations. For example, if you have purchased a subscription or utilized specific features on our platform, we are required to retain certain information to manage your account, provide ongoing support, and comply with contractual obligations. This retention period is not arbitrary; it is influenced by various legal requirements, such as bookkeeping and accounting laws, which dictate the minimum duration for which certain records must be kept. These legal stipulations ensure transparency and accountability in our business practices. When we determine that your information is no longer necessary for operational purposes or legal compliance, we will take appropriate action to delete your data. This may involve complete removal from our databases, ensuring that it cannot be recovered or accessed. In some cases, we may choose to anonymize your information instead, which means we will strip away any identifiers that could link the data back to you, thereby preserving aggregated information for analytical purposes without compromising your privacy. Furthermore, if we have previously obtained your consent to process your personal data and you subsequently decide to withdraw that consent, we will act promptly to delete your personal information unless we have other legal grounds—such as a contractual obligation or regulatory requirement—that necessitate its continued retention. This comprehensive approach underscores our commitment to safeguarding your privacy while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

          <h2>Account Protection</h2>
          <p>
          The security of your account is of utmost importance, and your password serves as the essential key that controls access to your personal profile and the range of services we provide. It is critical to understand that you hold complete responsibility for all activities that take place under your username. This responsibility underscores the necessity of keeping your password confidential and secure. Sharing your password with anyone—whether it's a friend, family member, or anyone else—compromises the integrity of your account. When you share your password, you risk unauthorized individuals accessing your account, which could lead to the misuse of your personal information and resources. Such misuse can have serious implications, including identity theft, unauthorized transactions, and fraudulent activities that may occur in your name, resulting in significant legal repercussions and damage to your reputation.
          </p>

          <p>
          In addition to safeguarding your password, it is vital to adopt best practices for password management. Use strong, complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using easily guessable information, such as birthdays or common words. Furthermore, changing your password regularly is an essential step in maintaining security. If you notice any unusual activity on your account or suspect that your password has been compromised—perhaps due to a phishing attempt, data breach, or any other suspicious circumstances—it is imperative that you take immediate action by changing your password. This swift response is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to your account and for protecting your sensitive personal information from potential threats.
          </p>

          <p>
          Moreover, consider enabling additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification beyond just your password. This additional step can significantly enhance the security of your account, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access. Always remain vigilant and proactive about your account security, and familiarize yourself with the tools and resources available to protect your information. By prioritizing your account's security, you contribute to a safer and more secure online experience for yourself and the broader community.

          <h2>Children’s Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
          At Indrajala Movie Makers LLP, we are acutely aware of the responsibilities that come with operating an online platform, particularly regarding the protection of children’s privacy. Our firm policy is to avoid targeting any of our products or services toward children under the age of eighteen (18). We recognize that children are more vulnerable when it comes to sharing personal information, and as such, we take deliberate steps to ensure that our content and services are intended for a mature audience. This means that our marketing strategies, product offerings, and the nature of the content we provide are specifically designed for individuals who meet the legal age requirements set forth in various jurisdictions. To safeguard against the unintentional collection of personal information from children, we have implemented stringent measures. We do not knowingly gather personal data from users under eighteen (18), and we actively encourage parents and guardians to be involved in their children's online activities. If you are a minor and wish to use our Site, it is crucial that you do so only under the supervision of a responsible adult—such as a parent or legal guardian. This supervision is not only a means of ensuring that minors access appropriate content, but it also allows for guidance in navigating the complexities of online interactions, including the sharing of personal information.
          </p>

          <p>
          In the event that we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under eighteen (18), we will promptly take action to delete such data from our systems. This process includes identifying the information, removing it from our databases, and ensuring that any associated user accounts are closed in compliance with our privacy practices. Our commitment to protecting children’s privacy is not just a legal obligation; it is a fundamental aspect of our ethical responsibility to create a safe digital environment. Moreover, we understand the importance of transparency in our operations. Therefore, we provide clear guidelines and resources for parents and guardians to help them understand how to manage their children's online interactions effectively. By fostering an open dialogue about online safety and encouraging parental oversight, we aim to create a protective buffer for young users, allowing them to explore digital content safely while minimizing risks associated with sharing personal information. Our policies reflect a holistic approach to privacy and safety, underscoring our dedication to maintaining high standards of integrity in our interactions with all users, especially children.

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
          At Indrajala Movie Makers LLP, we prioritize the security of your personal information and recognize the critical importance of protecting the data you entrust to us. When you share your personal details with us, we treat this information as a valuable asset that requires robust protection. To safeguard your data against unauthorized access and disclosure, we employ a variety of security measures, including encryption technologies, secure passwords, and physical security protocols. These tools and practices are designed to create multiple layers of security, helping to ensure that your personal information remains safe from potential threats.
          </p>

          <p>
          Despite our comprehensive security efforts, it's important to acknowledge that no method of data transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. There is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we recognize that other users of our platform may misuse or abuse the personal information you provide. As a result, while we work diligently to protect your information, we cannot promise that your personal data or private communications will always remain confidential or secure.
          </p>

          <p>
          It is also crucial to understand that information collected by third parties, such as advertisers or external service providers, may not benefit from the same level of security as the data you submit directly to us. We are not responsible for the security of such third-party information, nor can we control their security practices. Therefore, we encourage users to exercise caution when sharing personal information, especially when engaging with third-party services or platforms. Our commitment to your privacy and security remains a top priority, and we continuously evaluate and enhance our security measures to adapt to evolving threats in the digital landscape.
