          <p>
          This document outlines the Terms and Conditions Agreement (referred to as "Agreement" or "Terms") governing your use of the products and services provided by Indrajala Movie Makers LLP through its platform. It is essential for users (referred to as "User," "You," or "Your") to read and agree to these Terms, along with any future amendments, before accessing the Indrajala platform, which includes the website and mobile applications. These Terms apply to anyone utilizing the platform for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial. By engaging with the Indrajala platform, you acknowledge that you accept and will adhere to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, regardless of whether you are a registered user. Indrajala is dedicated to delivering a seamless and efficient user experience; however, due to the dynamic nature of the Internet, uninterrupted access to the platform cannot be guaranteed. There may be times when access to the site is temporarily suspended or restricted for necessary maintenance, repairs, or updates. Indrajala will make every effort to minimize the duration and frequency of such interruptions, but users should be aware that service disruptions may occur without prior notice. This ensures that users understand the operational constraints that may impact their access to the Indrajala platform.

          <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
          <p>
          Users represent and warrant that they possess the legal right to access and utilize the products offered by Indrajala Movie Makers LLP (referred to as "HMVL"), including the website and any associated services. Only individuals authorized under applicable law to enter into legally binding agreements are eligible to use these products. Furthermore, the usage of the Indrajala platform is strictly limited to personal purposes; any commercial exploitation of the site, app, or products is explicitly prohibited and may lead to legal consequences. Users are encouraged to conduct their due diligence before engaging in any transactions or purchases on the platform. Access to HMVL products will be denied to users whose accounts have been temporarily or indefinitely suspended. To become a registered user of the Indrajala platform, users must follow a straightforward registration process available on the website or app. This involves completing an online registration form and providing essential information, such as name and contact details. Upon successful registration, HMVL will create an account for the user, assigning a unique user alias (User ID) and password for secure login access. Users registering on behalf of another individual must confirm their authority to bind that person under this Agreement and ensure that all information provided during registration is accurate and complete. By registering, users consent to the inclusion of their personal data in HMVL's online database and authorize the sharing of this information with other users. HMVL reserves the right to refuse registration, deny access, or suspend or terminate user accounts at its discretion, without prior notice, in the interest of HMVL or its user community, without incurring any liability.
