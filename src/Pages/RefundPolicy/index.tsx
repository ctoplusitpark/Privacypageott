          <h2>Refunds for Content and Dissatisfaction</h2>
          <p>
          Indrajala LLP is committed to providing high-quality content and ensuring customer satisfaction. However, it is important to clarify our stance on refunds related to content dissatisfaction. While we strive to meet and exceed your expectations, we do not offer refunds if the content provided does not align with what you anticipated.

          <p>
          Our team at Indrajala Movie Makers works diligently to curate a diverse range of engaging and entertaining content. We believe in transparency and want our users to have realistic expectations. As a result, we encourage you to explore our offerings thoroughly before making a purchase or subscribing.

          <p>
          If you find that our content does not meet your needs, you retain the right to cancel your subscription or choose not to renew it at the end of your billing cycle. However, please note that cancellations will not result in any refund or compensation. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we appreciate your understanding of our policy.

          <h2>Refunds for Technical Issues</h2>
          <p>
          As an OTT platform operating on information technology, Indrajala LLP acknowledges that technical issues may occasionally arise. These outages can be either planned maintenance or unforeseen disruptions, which may lead to various technical difficulties for our users. In the event of such technical issues caused by our platform, users will be eligible for an extension of their current account deadlines.
          </p>

          <p>
          Please note that while users may receive an extension, the final decision regarding the length of the extension and the specific number of days will be determined by the Indrajala Movie Makers LLP team. However, we would like to clarify that there will be no financial refunds issued for these technical issues. Our goal is to ensure that you continue to enjoy our content without interruption, and we appreciate your understanding in this matter.
